## Why I chose This
I selected this paper because it provides a comprehensive, unified analysis of over 5,000 soybean RNA-seq samples, with a particular focus on leaf and root tissues. Since my PhD research also examines these tissues under CO2 stress, reviewing their reproducible R-based pipeline will help me develop a professional, standardized analysis framework for my own data.
