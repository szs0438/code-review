## Project Proposal: RNA-Seq Analysis of Soybean (Leaf vs. Root)
Effect of Ambient vs. Elevated CO2 on Leaf and Root Tissues
### 1. Project Goal
This project aims to analyze the gene expression changes in Glycine max when grown under different atmospheric conditions. I am focusing on two tissues: Leaves and Roots.

### 2. Experimental Design
Tissues: Leaf, Root
Conditions: Ambient CO2, Elevated CO2
Year of Data Collection: 2025
4. Computational Plan
To complete the "Scripting for Biologists" requirements, I will:

Use Bash/Terminal (Ubuntu) to manage directories and run Quality Control (FastQC) on the soybean leaf and root files.
Use Python to read the sample metadata and organize the results for ambient and elevated CO2 treatments.
Use Git/GitHub for version control to ensure my research workflow is documented and reproducible.
